# Chapter 1 Matrices and Gaussian Elimination
* Just to record my own thought and answer,if there has any error,please leave a message in the comment area. 
## 1.1 Introduction    
### Notation  
* L $\rightarrow$ lower triangular matrix  
* U $\rightarrow$ upper triangular matrix  
`Why use L and U matrix notation in here, because of Gaussian Elimination. Gaussian Elimination will eliminate the variables of equations.`  
We multiply $A$ by "elimination matrices" at reach an upper triangular matrix U. Those steps factor $A$ into L times U, where L is lower triangular.  

## 1.2 The Geometry of Linear Equations  
### Notation  
* Column Vectors  
* Linear Combinations  
The second approach looks at the columns of the linear system. The two separate equations are really one vector equation.  
`The real point is that to find the combination of the column vectors on the left side that produces the vector on the right side.`  
### Problem Set  
`Just thinking for recommend questions`  
* 1.2.3 Use the Gaussian Elimination will get $u + w = 2$ line. If $u = -1$ is included, the will be a point. If the fourth equation is $z = -2$, the four equations will have no solution.  
* 1.2.10 Suppose the 3 points is on a line $y = kx + b$, then we have $y_1 = b$, $y_2 = k + b$, and $y_3 = 2k + b$, use elimination we have $y_3 = 2y_2 - y_1$.
