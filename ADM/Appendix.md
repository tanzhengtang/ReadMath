## The Natural Numbers  
* $\forall n \in N$, is closed under addtion and multiplication.  
* Say $a$ `divides` $b$ if there is a natural number $k$ such that $b = ak$, $a$ is a `divisor` or a `factor` of b 
* A number p is `prime` if p is greater than 1 and the only numbers that divide p is 1 and p itself, which means just the two numbers 1 divides p and p divides p.  
* A `composite` is a number that is neither 1 nor prime. Just think simply, for example $6 = 2 * 3$, then 6 is composite.  
* A composite have only one way to write a product of its `prime divisors`. For example, $36 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 2^2*3^2$.  

## The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic   
Every natural number larger than $1$ is prime or can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime.  
For example $2200 = 2^3 * 5^2 * 11$, there is no other prime divisors of 2200.   

## The Integers

## Real and Rational Numbers  
* A real number $x$ is rational if there are integers $p$ and $q$,  with $q \neq 0$, such that $x = p/q$.  

## Complex Numbers  
* A complex number has the form of $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real number and $i$ is $-1^{\frac{1}{2}}$ whiche means $i^2 = -1$.  

## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  
Every polynomial in one varirable with complex coefficients and degree $n > 0$ exactly has $n$ zeros in the complex number system.  
Example, $x^4 + 4x^3 + 13x^2 = 0 \rightarrow x^2(x^2 + 4x + 13) = 0$, obviously there are $x = 0$ twice, and $x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0$ has root of $x = -2 + 3i$ and $x = -2 - 3i$.
