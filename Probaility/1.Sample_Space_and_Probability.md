* Elements of a Probabilistic Model  
The sample space $\omega$, which is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  
The probability law, which assigns to a set $A$ of possible outcomes a nonnegative number $P(A)$ that encodes our knowledge or belief about the collective likelihood of the elements of $A$. The probability law must satisfy certain properites to be introduced shortly.  
* Sample Spaces and Events  
Every probabilistic model involves an underlying process, called the experiment, that will produce exactly one out of several possible outcomes. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space of the experiment.  
A subset of the sample space, that is, a collection of possible outcomes, is called an event.  
* Probability Axioms  
Nonnegativity: $P(A) \ge 0$, for every event $A$.  
Additivity: if $A$ and $B$ are two disjoint events, then the probability of their union statisfies $P(A ~\bigcup~ B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
Normaliztion: The probability of the entire sample space $\omega$ is equal to 1, that is $P(\omega) = 1$.  
* Discrete Probability Law  
If the sample space consists of a finite number of possible outcomes, then the probability law is specified by the probabilities of the events that consist of a single element. In particular, the probability of any event $\{S_1,S_2,...,S_n \}$ is the sum of the probabilities of its elements: $P(\{S_1, S_2,....,S_n \}) = P(S_1) + P(S_2) + ... + P(S_n)$.  
* Discrete Uniform Probability Law 
If the sample space consists of $n$ possible outcomes which are equally likely,  then  the  probaÂ­bility of any event A is given by $P(A) =  \frac{\text{number~of~elements~of~} A}{n}$.  
* Some Properties of Probaility Laws  
(a) If $A \subset B$, then $P(A) \le P(B)$.  
(b) $P(A ~\bigcup~ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ~\bigcap~ B)$.  
(c) $P(A ~\bigcup~ B) \le P(A) + P(B)$.  
(d) $P(A ~\bigcup~ B ~\bigcup~ C) = P(A) + P(A^c ~\bigcap~ B) + P(A^c ~\bigcap~ B^c ~\bigcap~ C)$.
