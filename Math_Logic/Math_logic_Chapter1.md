# Chapter 1 Preliminaries  
## 1.1 Exercise  
* 1.1.1 Suppose $p_1 = 1$ and $p_2 = 3$, thus $p_1 * p_2 + 1 = 4$.  

## 1.2 Exercise
* 1.2.1 Skip.  
* 1.2.2 Skip.  
* 1.2.3 $P_1(x)$ is $x = 1$, $P_2(x)$ is that every real number except 0 multiply by $1/x$ equals itself, $P_3(x)$ is $x^2 = 1$ and $x > 0$. $Q_1(x)$ is $x \notin Z$, $Q_2(x)$ is $-1 < x< 0$, $Q_3(x)$ is $0 < x < 1$.  
* 1.2.4 (1) A is $x \le 1$ and B is $x \ge 1$. (2) $\forall x \in C \cap D \rightarrow x \in C \bigwedge x \in D \rightarrow C \cap D \subset C \bigwedge C \cap D \subset D \rightarrow C \cap D \subset C \cup D$, there has a element $n$ in $C \cap D$ but not in $C \cup D$, this is a contradiction.  

## 1.3 Exercise. 
* 1.3.1 (1) If a = 2, b = 1, c = 3, the conclusion is wrong. (2) $a = k * b, b = m * c \rightarrow a = k * m * c \rightarrow a = g * c$. (3) It's wrong if sb > a or tc > a. (4) $a = m * b, b = k * a \rightarrow a = m * k * a \rightarrow m * k = 1 \rightarrow m = 1,k = 1$ or $m = -1, k = -1$, then $a = -1 * b$ or $a = 1 * b$. (5) $a  = k * b, a > 0, b > 0 \rightarrow k > 0 \rightarrow a \ge b$. (6) Skip.  
* 1.3.2 Skip.  
* 1.3.3 Skip.  

## 1.4 Exercise  
* 1.4.1 Skip.  
* 1.4.2 Skip.  
* 1.4.3 For second function, let g(n) = 1, we gould get n = 1/2, which contradicion with $n \in Z$, then g is not surjective.  
* 1.4.4 (1) True. (2) False. (3) True. (4) False. (5) False. (6) False.  
* 1.4.5 (1) True. (2) True. (3) False. Suppose $f(x) = x, g(x) = -x$, then $(g+f)(x) = 0$.  
* 1.4.6 (1) If g is not injective, then have $x \neq x^o$ such that $g(x)=g(x^o)$ and $\forall f, f(g(x)) = f(g(x^o))$, this will be contradicition with $g(f(x))$ is injective. (2) $g = x^{1/2}$ and $f(x) = x^2$.  
* 1.4.7
